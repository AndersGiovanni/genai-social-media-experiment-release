I haven’t had nearly as many dogs as I have had cats so I could definitely be wrong on this. But I’ve seen my cats do some VERY smart things and I just haven’t had the experience with dogs to know if they can compete. I’m interested to hear some of the smartest things you’ve seen a dog do, so I can stop thinking they are less intelligent. I love dogs and I want to believe that they are smart too, I just haven’t seen it yet. The ones I’ve had just seemed dumb compared to my cats.",
