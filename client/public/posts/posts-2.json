I agree with a lot of his views, one of them being universal basic income. The world is just going to get more and more automated.\n\nWhat do we do when people are losing their jobs to robots? With self driving cars becoming more of a reality, delivery jobs are going to be obsolete in the very near future. It’s much cheaper to buy a vehicle once that can drive 24/7 than it is to pay a human being to work 8 hour shifts.\n\nThe experiments that have been done so far implementing universal basic income have been overwhelmingly positive, improving quality of life in the places it was tested. I would like to hear some reason against UBI so I can be better informed, thanks!",
