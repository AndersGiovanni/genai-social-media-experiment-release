So what do we do to get these things for them? Typically, the solution presented is to tax the people who are earning, and giving it to those who aren't. In effect, further denying people the right to keep the fruit of their labor, instead giving it to those who didn't earn it.",

My goal is just to take the poorest people and at least give them the resources to meet their basic needs. There would still be extremely rich people who have more money than they can ever spend, but at least the poorest people in the country get to sit in small houses rather than boxes.",
